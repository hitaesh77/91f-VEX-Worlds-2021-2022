driver function and autonomous code for worlds bot

This is the code we used for states and worlds in Tipping Point. Inside you will find driver functions for all the movement within motors, as well as multiple autonomous programs. Among these programs is a sub 0.6 second goal rush which was used a lot during our state competition which gave us the competitive edge when it came to goal rushing. Couple this with a kickstand during worlds, we had one of the fastest goal rushes in our division. You will also find a center tall neutral goal rush along with a full AWP path and also a goal rush for the left side. Note: all goal rushes get the respective side's ring in the goal.
